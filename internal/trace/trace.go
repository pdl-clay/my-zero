// Package trace records per-turn timing for a Zero agent run.
//
// Tracing is opt-in. A *Recorder is attached to agent.Options and threaded
// through the run via context (see FromContext / WithContext). When the
// recorder is nil, every stamp is a no-op and the agent loop, providers, and
// tools are byte-identical to an untraced run.
//
// The emitted NDJSON is compatible with internal/agenteval's trace contract:
// one JSON object per line carrying a "type" (and usually "name") field, so
// agenteval.ParseTraceEventKeys / MissingTraceEvents can validate a run.
//
// Attribution model. Each stamp records a wall interval [start, end]. Spans
// that run concurrently or are nested (e.g. provider_connect inside generation,
// permission_wait inside tool_execution) are NOT summed into each other. The
// recorder derives a parent for each span by interval containment and computes
// per-span exclusive time (duration minus the union of its children's
// intervals). AttributedDuration is the sum of top-level (non-nested) spans —
// the time accounted for without double-counting. Coverage is the fraction of
// wall covered by the union of all span intervals; it is the honest "≥95% of
// wall accounted for" metric and never exceeds 1.
