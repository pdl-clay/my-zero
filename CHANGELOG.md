## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Shared multi-agent skills discovery: when present, `~/.agents/skills` is searched after the primary
  Zero skills dir (and before plugin skill roots). `zero skills list` / `info` and the runtime `skill`
  tool share one multi-root discovery path; install/remove/lock still target only the Zero skills directory.
- `SECURITY.md` with a private vulnerability-reporting path, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, this changelog, and
  GitHub issue/PR templates.
- Interactive `/theme` picker: bare `/theme` opens a popup that live-previews each palette as you move
  and applies on select (Esc reverts).
- Ten built-in color themes alongside the `dark`/`light` built-ins — `dracula`, `nord`, `gruvbox`,
  `tokyo-night`, `catppuccin`, `one-dark`, `solarized-dark`, `rose-pine`, `everforest`, and
  `solarized-light` — selectable via `/theme <name>`, `--theme <name>`, or `ZERO_THEME`. Every palette
  is contrast-audited to WCAG AA. The built-in light theme was reworked for legibility.
- `--theme <name>` flag for the TUI, accepting `auto` or any registered theme (previously only the
  `ZERO_THEME` env var existed).
- "Accessibility / Appearance" section in the README documenting `NO_COLOR`, `ZERO_THEME`, `/theme`,
  and `ZERO_NO_FADE`.

### Changed
- Provider connectivity health checks now allow loopback hosts for explicitly user-configured local
  providers (Ollama / LM Studio), so the keyless local-model path verifies instead of failing with
  "localhost hosts are blocked". The SSRF guard for fetched/remote URLs is unchanged.
- Auth (401/403) errors now show a curated, actionable message pointing at `zero auth` / setup; the
  raw upstream body is shown only under a verbose/debug flag.
- No-provider / missing-key errors now point at `zero setup` and `zero auth`, and distinguish a
  missing key from a rejected key.
- `zero doctor` no longer reports "Overall: pass" when no provider credential is configured, and
  formats the missing-language-server list for humans (no raw Go `map[...]`).
- Raised the `faint`/`faintest` theme tokens (and the light-theme accent) to meet WCAG AA contrast for
  the content they carry.
- `NO_COLOR` is now honored for any non-empty value, per the no-color.org spec.

### Removed
- The inert `/input-style` slash command (it had no backend).

### Fixed
- README/`go.mod` Go-version mismatch and other stale public-release docs claims.
